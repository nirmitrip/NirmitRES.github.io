# Nirmit  
### Ethical Hacking • Penetration Testing • Threat Detection

> **Offense-informed defense. Defense-informed offense.**

I am a cybersecurity practitioner focused on hands-on ethical hacking, penetration testing, and detection engineering. I build real lab environments to simulate attacks, analyze system behavior, and understand how threats are detected in modern security operations.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Perform attack simulations in controlled lab environments  
- Study how systems are compromised and how defenses respond  
- Build SIEM-based detection labs (Wazuh, log monitoring, alert analysis)  
- Practice offensive security techniques using Kali Linux  
- Analyze authentication logs, processes, and network activity  

---

## 🎯 Career Focus

My goal is to become a **Professional Ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester**, with strong knowledge of:

- Offensive security methodologies  
- Vulnerability discovery and exploitation  
- Network reconnaissance  
- Detection evasion concepts  
- Security monitoring and alert analysis

## 🛠 Technical Areas

### Offensive Security
- Network scanning & enumeration  
- Attack simulation  
- System exploitation fundamentals  

### Defensive Security
- SIEM deployment (Wazuh)  
- Log analysis  
- Threat detection  
- Endpoint monitoring
