# Endpoint Telemetry & Behavioral Monitoring Tool

## Overview
This project involved developing a Python-based endpoint monitoring utility to study system-level input capture and behavioral logging within an isolated virtual environment.

The goal was to understand host-level visibility, input event monitoring, and structured logging mechanisms in a controlled lab setting.

---

## Architecture
- Python event listener implementation
- System-level keyboard input monitoring
- Structured local log storage
- Controlled virtual machine execution environment

---

## Monitoring Implementation
- Utilized system event listener library for input capture
- Filtered and normalized keystroke data
- Implemented structured logging format
- Stored captured input in secure local log file

The tool was executed strictly within an isolated lab VM to ensure safe experimentation and controlled analysis.

---

## Observations
- Studied host-level input capture behavior
- Evaluated system response and visibility artifacts
- Analyzed how endpoint-level activity may be logged or monitored
- Observed differences in execution behavior under various configurations

---

## Key Takeaways
- Improved understanding of endpoint telemetry mechanisms
- Strengthened knowledge of host-level monitoring concepts
- Explored behavioral data logging practices
- Gained insight into detection visibility at the endpoint layer
